POST submit
-- parse the string into words
  -- No requirements around stripping punctuation, normalizing case, etc.
-- save to an ordered data structure keyed by timestamp (efficient retrieval of last 60 seconds)
-- data to save is a map<string,int> of word to count

GET statistics
-- get all submissions in last 60 seconds
-- merge the maps together
-- return consolidated map


Performance Optimizations:
- Since filtering granularity is by second, we can pre-compute and group each second's submissions into a single map
